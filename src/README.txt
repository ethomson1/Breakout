*Starting the Game*
From the splash screen, user should press ENTER to start the game. 

*Gameplay*
Once on the game screen, user must click the screen to launch the ball. From there, the left and right arrow keys control the ball. The goal is to use the paddle to knock out all of the bricks, and to not allow the ball to touch the bottom of the screen.

To return to the main menu during gameplay, use the [Q] key. However, ALL GAME PROGRESS WILL BE LOST. 

*Cheats*
To see the NEW extra level, press [N].

*Winning the Game*
The user will win the game when they have successfully cleared all levels.

*Game Over*
If the user lets the ball reach the bottom of the screen, the game is over and the user loses.

*Ball Speed*
My app is designed to work best with ball speeds 70-120.
